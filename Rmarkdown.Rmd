This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Background

This is IT incident data downloaded in the SNOW between 2018-07-01 to 2019-10-31, last refreshed at 2019-11-01 

# Data exploration

* read data file names
```{r read raw files, include=FALSE}
getwd()
file_name <- list.files(path="./files/", pattern = NULL)
file_path <- paste(getwd(),"/files/", file_name, sep="")
```

```{r 00110, echo=FALSE}
cat("Incident data is creatd by midserver or guest:", comma(n1-n2,digits=0), 
    "out of", comma(n1,digits=0), ",", round((n1-n2)/n1*100), "%")
```

There is data having no creation date, 21872, it needs to remove the data 
Why does this error often occur? 
```{r 00120, echo=FALSE}
data %>% mutate(NG = ifelse(business_duration == calendar_duration, 1,0), 
                yyyymm = as.Date(str_c(substr(created_on, 1,7), "-01"))) %>% 
  group_by(yyyymm) %>% dplyr::summarise(wrong_duration = sum(NG), total = n(), percent = comma(wrong_duration/total*100)) %>% arrange(desc(yyyymm))
```
